# Python Courses: Basic for Backend

This repository contains my Python practice lessons.  
Each folder represents a separate lecture with examples and exercises.

## Lessons Overview

### Lesson 1: Introduction
- **Topic:** Typing, Variables, Strings, Numbers, Boolean Algebra, Branching  
- **Folder:** `1. Introduction. Typing. Variables. Strings and Numbers. Boolean Algebra. Branching`  
- **File:** `lection_1_python_2025.py`  
- **Description:** Basics of Python, variables, strings, numbers, boolean logic, and conditional branching.

### Lesson 2: Exception Handling, Lists, Strings, Slices, Loops
- **Topic:** Exception Handling, Lists, Strings in Detail, Slices, Loops  
- **Folder:** `2. Exception Handling. Lists, Strings in Detail, Slices, Loops`  
- **Files:**  
  - `lection_2_python_2025.py`  
  - `practice.py`  
- **Description:** Learn how to handle errors with `try/except`, work with lists and strings, understand slicing, and use loops in depth.

#### 🧠 Practice Tasks
1. Create a list `numbers` with numbers from 1 to 10.  
   - Print each number squared.  
   - Find the sum of all numbers.  

2. Create a string `text` and print each character in a loop.  

3. Use slices to print the first 5 and last 5 characters of `text`.  

4. Print numbers from 1 to 20 divisible by 3.  

5. Find the sum of numbers from 1 to 100 using a `while` loop.  

6. Create an infinite loop asking the user for a number and print its square.  
   - Exit when the user enters `0` or `exit`.  

7. Print unique words from a list with duplicates.  

8. Ask the user for text and count vowels (`a, e, i, o, u`).  

9. Replace all occurrences of a word in a sentence with `"replaced"`.  

10. Remove duplicates from a list without using sets.  

11. Find the smallest and largest number in a list **without** using built-in functions.  

12. Implement the **FizzBuzz** task:
    - Print numbers from 1 to `n`.
    - Replace multiples of 3 with `"Fizz"`, 5 with `"Buzz"`, and both with `"FizzBuzz"`.  

12.1 Make FizzBuzz dynamic — ask the user for both divisors and `n`.

### Lesson 3: None, Range, List Comprehension, Sum, Max, Min, Len, Sorted, All, Any, Working with Files
- **Topic:** Built-in Python functions and file handling  
- **Folder:** `3. None. Range, List Comprehension, Sum, Max, Min, Len, Sorted, All, Any, Working with Files`  
- **File:** `lection_3_python_2025.py`  
- **Description:** Exploring the `None` type, working with ranges and list comprehensions, using built-in functions like `sum`, `max`, `min`, `len`, `sorted`, `all`, `any`, and learning the basics of file operations.

## How to Run a Lesson

1. Open a terminal in the desired lesson folder.  
2. Run the Python file, for example:
   ```bash
   python lection_2_python_2025.py
