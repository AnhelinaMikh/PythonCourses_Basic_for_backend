"""ðŸ§  Practice:

1. Create a list numbers with numbers from 1 to 10.
Using a for loop, print each number from the list raised to the power of two.
Then, using a for loop, find the sum of all numbers in the numbers list.

2. Create a string text with any text.
Using a for loop, print each character from the text string.

3. Using string slicing, print the first 5 and the last 5 characters of the text string.

4. Create a list of numbers from 1 to 20.
Using a for loop, print all numbers from the list that are divisible by 3 without a remainder.

5. Using a while loop, find the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100.

6. Create an infinite loop using while True, which asks the user to input a number and prints its square.
Add a condition to exit the loop when the user enters "0" or "exit".

7. Create a list of words words, including some repeating words.
Using a for loop, print all unique words from the list.

8. Count vowels:
Ask the user to input a text string, and then use string methods to count the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string.

9. Word replacement:
Create a string containing a sentence and ask the user to enter a word.
Replace all occurrences of that word in the sentence with the word "replaced", and print the modified sentence.

10. Create a list with duplicate elements.
Use list methods to remove duplicates and print the updated list.

11. Create a list with random numbers.
Find the largest and smallest number (you are not allowed to use built-in methods like max() or min()).

12. FizzBuzz â€“ a classic interview task:
Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to n, replacing some of them according to divisibility rules:

For numbers divisible by 3 â€” print "Fizz".

For numbers divisible by 5 â€” print "Buzz".

For numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 â€” print "FizzBuzz".

For all other numbers â€” print the number itself.

Example for n = 15:
    
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz

12.1 Bonus:
Modify the program so that the user manually inputs both divisors and the value of n.
(Instead of fixed 3, 5, and 15 â€” use any numbers entered by the user.)"""
